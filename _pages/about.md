I am a master's student at [New York University (NYU)](https://www.nyu.edu/), pursuing an M.S. in Computer Engineering. I am currently working on my thesis at the [Ai4CE Lab](https://ai4ce.github.io/) under Prof. Chen Feng, focusing on research at the intersection of **robot perception** and **learning**.

Previously, I served as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Agile Robotics and Perception Lab (ARPL)](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/), where I worked on multi-robot collaborative perception and 3D scene understanding using LiDAR and vision-based sensor fusion.

Before joining NYU, I was a Research Associate at the [Computational Imaging Lab](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/comp_photolab/) at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), working on computational imaging and computer vision, advised by [Prof. Kaushik Mitra](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/) and [Prof. Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/sankaranarayanan-aswin.html). I completed my B.E. in Computer Engineering from [Savitribai Phule Pune University](http://www.unipune.ac.in/) in June 2023.

During my undergraduate studies, I was the Founding Machine Learning Intern at [Seisei.ai](https://www.seisei.ai/), where I worked on voice cloning and visual face dubbing using generative models. I was also awarded the prestigious [Mitacs Globalink Research Internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) and worked at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/) on deep learning in biological physics under [Prof. Andrew Rutenberg](http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~adr/).

Previously, I served as an Applied Research Fellow at the [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), working on object detection and classification problems, advised by [Prof. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla](https://ravika.github.io/), [Dr. Rohit Saluja](https://rohitsaluja22.github.io/), and [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/). I also interned at the [Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR)](https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs-and-establishments/centre-artificial-intelligence-robotics-cair), [DRDO](https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/), where I worked on pedestrian detection and path prediction.

### Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **robotics**, **computer vision**, and **reinforcement learning**, with a focus on:

- **Robot perception** in dynamic and unstructured environments
- **Vision-based decision-making** and **adaptive robot learning**
- **Autonomous systems**, with a major focus on **autonomous navigation**, and **autonomous driving**  
- **Learning-based planning and control**  

I am passionate about building autonomous robotic systems capable of real-world perception, interaction, and decision-making.
