I am an upcoming master's student at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), majoring in Computer Engineering. I recently completed my Research Associate work at the [Computational Imaging Lab](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/comp_photolab/) at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in the domain of computer vision, and computational imaging where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kaushik Mitra](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/), and [Prof. Aswin C Sankaranarayanan](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/sankaranarayanan-aswin.html). I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering at [Savitribai Phule Pune University](http://www.unipune.ac.in/) in June'23.



Previously, in my final semester, I worked as a Founding Machine Learning Intern at [Seisei.ai](https://www.seisei.ai/), where my work was specifically related to voice cloning and visual face dubbing using Generative models. I am the recipient of the esteemed [Mitacs Globalink Research internship Award](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) where I worked in the domain of deep learning, and biological physics at [Dalhousie University, Halifax](https://www.dal.ca/) in the summers of 2022, under the supervision of [Prof. Andrew Rutenberg](http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~adr/). In my sixth semester, I have also worked as an Applied Research Fellow at the [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) on object detection, and classification problems advised by [Prof. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla](https://ravika.github.io/), [Dr. Rohit Saluja](https://rohitsaluja22.github.io/), and [Prof. C V Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/). Lastly, I have also worked as a winter research intern in my fifth semester on pedestrian detection and path prediction at the [Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics(CAIR) lab](https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs-and-establishments/centre-artificial-intelligence-robotics-cair) at [Defence Research and Development Organisation(DRDO)](https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/). 

# Research Interests

My research interest is in **Autonomous Robotics**, which are built for interactive decision-making, manipulation, and real-world perception. I want to work at the intersection of **robotics, computer vision**, and **reinforcement learning**.

To achieve this goal, I am highly passionate about working on problems related to **vision-based autonomous decision-making, multi-sensor integration, manipulation, navigation and path planning, motion control**, and **robot learning and adaptation**. I have previously worked on problems related to object and pedestrian detection, path prediction, voice cloning, face dubbing, image enhancement, and image restoration.  

I am actively looking for research opportunities and collaborations. Please feel free to contact me for any research opportunity in **autonomous robotics**, and **computer vision**.

This Flag counter seemed fun to me. It shows flag counts from January 2024.
