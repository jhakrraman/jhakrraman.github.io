I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering at [Savitribai Phule Pune University](http://www.unipune.ac.in/) in June'23. I am currently working as a Research Associate at the [Computational Imaging Lab](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/comp_photolab/) at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in the domain of computer vision, and computational imaging where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kaushik Mitra](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/), and [Prof. Aswin C Sankaranarayanan](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/sankaranarayanan-aswin.html). 

I have worked as an Applied Research Fellow at the [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) in the domain of computer vision where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla](https://ravika.github.io/), [Prof. Rohit Saluja](https://rohitsaluja22.github.io/), and [Prof. C V Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/). I am the recipient of the esteemed [Mitacs Globalink Research internship Award](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) where I worked in the domain of Deep Learning as a research intern at [Dalhousie University, Halifax](https://www.dal.ca/) under the supervision of [Prof. Andrew Rutenberg](http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~adr/).
