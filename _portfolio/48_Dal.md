>Worked as a Mitacs Globalink Research Intern at Dalhousie University, Halifax where I was supervised by Prof. Andrew Rutenberg.    
>Worked on a model for classifying which health variable are of low dimensions and of high dimension for death.    
>Used variational autoencoder and RNN for the model and used the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA).    
>Optimized the loss function for every health variable for the model.    
<!--         >The prediction results were positive and now working on the paper for the same. -->
