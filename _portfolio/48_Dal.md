>Worked as a Mitacs Globalink Research Intern at Dalhousie University, Halifax where Prof. Andrew Rutenberg supervised me.    
>Worked on a model for classifying which health variables are of low dimensions and of high dimensions for death.    
>Used variational autoencoder and RNN for the model and used the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA).    
>Optimized the loss function for every health variable for the model.
