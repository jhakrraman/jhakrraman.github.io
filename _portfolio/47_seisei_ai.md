>Worked on the transformation of videos with the help of Generative AI technologies.        
>Developed a system to detect and extract the landmarks from the face of a particular individual in a video.    
>Conversion and enhancement of voice in audios were performed using the GAN-based FreeVC model.      
>Incorporated DINet model in the system for performing visual face dubbing on the high-resolution videos.        
>The performance of the final model improved by 17% compared to the earlier one and later deployed on the system.
