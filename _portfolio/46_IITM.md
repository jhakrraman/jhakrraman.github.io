> Worked as a Research Associate at Computational Imaging Lab, IIT Madras, supervised by Prof. Kaushik Mitra, and closely collaborated with Prof. Aswin Sankaranarayanan.  
> Developed a cross-attention network for low-light image enhancement and restoration for autonomous systems.  
> Used thermal images as guidance for RGB inputs to boost the enhancement model’s performance.  
> Collected and presented the real-world V-TIEE dataset consisting of 50 RGB–thermal image pairs.  
> Demonstrated significant improvements over prior RGB-only methods.
