>Worked as a Research Associate at Computational Imaging Lab, IIT Madras, supervised by Prof. Kaushik Mitra, and closely collaborated with Prof. Aswin Sankaranarayanan.      
>Developed a Cross-attention network for low-light image enhancement and restoration for Autonomous systems.   
>Used Thermal images as a guide for RGB images to improve the performance of the enhancement algorithm.  
>Presented our own collected real-world V-TIEE dataset consisting of 40 RGB and thermal image pairs.  
>Significant improvements over the previous networks using only RGB images were observed.
