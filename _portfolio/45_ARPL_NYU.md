>Worked under the mentorship of Yang Zhou and the supervision of Prof. Giuseppe Loianno for adaptive keyframe selection.  
>Focused on scene reconstruction in dynamic environments using a transformer-based architecture.  
>Developed a model to regress point maps directly from RGB images for unstructured scene understanding.  
>Employed error-based metrics and momentum-based keyframe control to optimize frame selection.  
>Reduced the number of required keyframes while improving reconstruction quality and efficiency.
