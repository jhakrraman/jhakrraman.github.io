> Worked under the mentorship of Yang Zhou and supervision of Prof. Giuseppe Loianno for adaptive keyframe selection.  
> Focused on scene reconstruction in dynamic environments using a transformer-based architecture.  
> Designed a model to regress point maps from RGB images to capture unstructured environments.  
> Used error-based metrics and momentum-based keyframe control for keyframe selection.  
> Reduced the number of frames needed for reconstruction while improving overall reconstruction quality.
