>Worked as a Research Intern at the Centre of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab, DRDO.    
>Worked on a project to detect pedestrians and then predict their trajectories from the JAAD and PIE datasets.    
>Used Pedestron for the detection of pedestrians for both first-person view (FPV) and bird's-eye view (BEV) scenarios.    
>Used conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to encode observed trajectories and decode future trajectories.  
>The detection and prediction results were good and the whole system was deployed on a Robot.
