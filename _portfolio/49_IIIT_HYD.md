>Worked as an Applied Research Fellow at the Centre of Visual Information Technology Lab, IIIT Hyderabad, where Prof. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla and Prof. C V Jawahar guided me. 
>Developed a model to detect vehicle lights and then classify the status of the light on the Indian Driving Dataset.        
>Tested IDD on Facebook Detic model and then used YoloV3, YoloV4, and YoloV5 for detecting vehicle lights.        
>Used color thresholding on the RGB images for detecting the status of vehicle lights.        
>Achieved an mAP of 88.4% for the detection of vehicle lights and also performed well for classifying the status of lights.
