>Mentored by Yang Zhou and supervised by Prof. Giuseppe Loianno for the adaptive keyframe selection.      
>Worked on adaptive keyframe selection for scene reconstruction in the dynamic environment.   
>A transformer-based architecture to directly regress point maps from images to predict the scene in an unstructured environment.  
>It uses error-based metric, and momentum-based keyframe control for selection of keyframes for scene reconstruction.
>It decreased the required keyframes for reconstruction while enhancing the systemâ€™s reconstruction performance.
